When we think
of E equals m c-squared,

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,752
we have this vision of Einstein

00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,887
as an old, wrinkly man
with white hair.

00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:26,760
MAN 2:
E equals m c-squared is
not about an old Einstein.

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,163
It's actually about
a young, energetic, dynamic,

7
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,232
even a sexy Einstein.

10
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,881
of electrical force is emanating

00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,216

It is my great ambition
to demonstrate

19
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:08,535
that nature is a closed system;

20
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,503
that in any transformation,

00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:16,776
no amount of matter, no mass,
is ever lost and none is gained.

you are

Why ascribe

a vague and immeasurable
force like vis viva?

We can't harbor

NARRATOR:
A hundred years ago,

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,950
a deceptively simple formula
revealed a hidden unity

55
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,352
buried deep in the fabric
of the universe.

56
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,893
It tells
of a fantastic connection

57
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,596
between energy,
matter and light.

58
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,635
Its author was
a youthful Albert Einstein.

59
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:26,873
It's the most famous equation
in the world:

60
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:31,678
E equals m c-squared.

61
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,715
MAN:
All aboard!

( train whistle toots )

63
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,889
LITHGOW:
But while we've all heard

64
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,591
of Einstein's big idea,

65
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,126
very few of us know
what it means.

66
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,467
In fact, E equals m c-squared
is so remarkable

67
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,771
that even Einstein wasn't sure
if it was really true.

68
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,409
WOMAN:
Albert, darling,

69
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,446
you're later than I expected.

70
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,516
We've only got sausage
and cheese tonight.

71
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,686
What is it?

72
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,855
We need to talk.

73
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,290
Has something happened?

74
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,157
Oh, no, nothing.

75
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,926
Sorry, no.

76
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,828
I spent most of the day

77
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:26,099
staring out
the window at work
looking at trains,

78
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,267
and I started
to think

79
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:32,305
about an object
and how much energy it had.

80
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,406
Can I explain it to you?

81
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,574
Of course you can.

82
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,277
But first...
( kisses ) dinner!

83
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,112
Hmm? Food, then talk.

84
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,351
I think the gods
are laughing at me.

85
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,325
LITHGOW:
The gods were not laughing
at Einstein.

86
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,329
He'd united
in one stunning insight

87
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,432
the work of many
who had come before him--

88
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,969
scientists who'd fought
and even died

89
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,039
to create each part
of the equation.

90
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,908
The story
of E equals m c-squared

91
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,377
starts long before Einstein

92
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,681
with the discovery
of Efor energy.

93
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,629
In the early 19th century,

94
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,700
scientists didn't think
in terms of energy;

95
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,905
they thought in terms of
individual powersor forces.

96
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,175
These were all disconnected,
unrelated things:

97
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,512
the power of the wind,
the force of a door closing,

98
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,281
a crack of lightning.

99
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,415
( thunder rumbles )

100
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,717
The idea that there might be

101
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,287
some sort of overarching,
unifying energy

102
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:59,559
which lay behind all these
forces had yet to be revealed.

103
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,361
One lowly man's drive

104
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,464
to understand the hidden
mysteries of nature

105
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,799
would begin to change all that.

106
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,576
MAN:
Young Michael Faraday hated
his job.

107
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,112
He was uneducated,
the son of a blacksmith.

108
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,115
He'd been lucky to become
a bookbinder's apprentice.

109
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,651
But Faraday craved one thing.

110
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,719
He craved knowledge.

111
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,055
He read every book
that passed through his hands.

112
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,090
He developed
a passion for science.

113
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,128
All of his free time
and his meager wages were poured

114
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,529
into his self-education.

115
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,965
He was on the threshold
of an incredible journey

116
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,167
into the invisible world
of energy.

117
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,117
LITHGOW:
Faraday had impressed
one of his master's customers

118
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,821
and was rewarded with a ticket
that would change his life.

119
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,856
Excuse me, please.

120
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,858
Can I pass, please?

121
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,028
Can I pass?

122
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,831
Some of us are trying
to improve ourselves,

123
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,434
if people will let us.

124
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,935
Of course, of course--
pass, pass.

125
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,371
This way
to a better life.

126
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,672
( chuckles )

127
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:24,143
MAN:
In the early 1800s, science was
the pursuit of gentlemen,

128
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,947
something Faraday
was clearly not.

129
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,349
He had a rudimentary education,

130
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,721
he'd read widely,
he'd gone to public lectures,

131
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:39,459
but in 1812 he was given tickets
to hear Sir Humphry Davy,

132
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,161
the most prominent chemist
of the age.

133
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,999
( groans )

134
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,136
( laughing )

135
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,841
LITHGOW:
Nineteenth-century scientists
were the pop stars of their day.

136
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,410
Their lectures were
hugely popular.

137
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:03,082
Tickets were hard to come by,
and Davy reveled in his status.

138
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,484
They're waiting.

139
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,052
I know.

140
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,058
LITHGOW:
He was also a keen follower
of the latest fashion--

141
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,361
nitrous oxide, or laughing gas.

142
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:20,099
He said it had all the benefits
of alcohol without the hangover.

143
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,735
( laughing )

144
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,769
( clears throat )

145
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,005
Electricity, ladies
and gentlemen,

146
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,275
a mysterious force that can
unravel the confusing mixture

147
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,577
of intermingled substances

148
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,748
that surround us and produce
pure... pure elements!

149
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:39,185
GATES:
Davy was an absolutely
first-rate scientist.

150
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,920
However, many will come to say

151
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,556
that his greatest discovery is
Michael Faraday.

152
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,691
DAVY:
Metals-- unknown, that is,

153
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:50,196
until I isolated potassium
from molten potash and sodium,

154
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,365
as I showed you last time,
from common salt.

155
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,600
( voice fades ):
That same magical electric...

156
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,603
LITHGOW:
Faraday may not have been born
a gentleman,

157
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,540
but he wasn't going to let
class barriers stop him

158
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,276
from pursuing
a career in science.

159
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,913
He worked for nights on end

160
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:12,218
to bind his lecture notes
into a book for his new hero.

161
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:18,925
FARADAY:
Lord, help me to think
only of others...

162
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,894
to be of use to mankind.

163
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,230
Help me be part
of the great circle

164
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,465
that is your work and love.

165
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,369
Lord, I am your servant.

166
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,579
This is excellent work, Faraday.

167
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:44,750
So, what is it you aim
to do with your life?

168
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,321
My desire, sir, is
to escape from trade,

169
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,823
which I find vicious
and selfish,

170
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,792
and to become
a servant of science,

171
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:58,297
which, I imagine, makes its
pursuers amiable and liberal.

172
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,332
( laughs briefly )

173
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,401
Really?

174
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,937
Well, I shall leave it
to the experience of a few years

175
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,272
to set you right on that score.

176
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,542
Look, I haven't anything
at the moment.

177
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,244
I'll send a note
if anything comes up.

178
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,151
LITHGOW:
Despite this
humiliating setback,

179
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:23,389
Faraday was determined to
break free from his daily toil.

180
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,995
His patience was rewarded.

181
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,039
( explosion, then Davy screams )

182
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,416
DAVY:
Newman...

183
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,818
meet Mr. Michael
Faraday.

184
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,988
He's going to be my helper
while I recover.

185
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,058
He assures me he is
a Christian fellow.

186
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,894
Perhaps with God
and Faraday in charge
of the chemicals,

187
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,096
you and I will be safe
in our place of work.

188
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,499
Thank you,
Professor Davy.

189
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,566
Welcome, Faraday.

190
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,001
Oh, no, thank you,

191
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,569
and thank you,
Sir Humphry.

192
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,271
Just stick to your job
and do as you're told

193
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,173
and you'll be fine, Faraday.

194
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:25,051
LITHGOW:
Faraday became the laboratory
assistant, eagerly absorbing

195
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:29,388
every scrap of knowledge
that Davy deigned to impart.

196
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:33,359
But in time, the pupil
would surpass the master.

197
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,201
The big excitement of the day
was electricity.

198
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,537
Another charge, Newman.

199
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,672
LITHGOW:
The battery
had just been invented,

200
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,643
and all manner of experiments
were being done.

201
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,378
But no one really understood

202
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:57,316
what this strange force
of electricity was.

203
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,454
GATES:
The academic establishment
at the time thought

204
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,557
that electricity was, you know,

205
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,327
like a fluid flowing through
a pipe, pushing its way along.

206
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,097
But in 1821,
a Danish researcher showed

207
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,633
that when you pass an electric
current through a wire

208
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,435
and place a compass near it,

209
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,772
it deflected the needle
at right angles.

210
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,340
LITHGOW:
This was the first time

211
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,543
researchers had seen electricity
affect a magnet,

212
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,145
the first glimpse of two forces

213
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,749
which had previously been seen
as entirely separate

214
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,785
now unified
in some inexplicable way.

215
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,053
Faraday, come
look at this.

216
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,955
You're the bright
spark around here.

217
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,456
Perhaps you
can work it out.

218
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,159
Oersted's reported
an amazing finding.

219
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,861
We're just
replicating it here.

220
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,897
Let's try the compass
on the other side.

221
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,602
MAN:
Now, that is

222
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,470
remarkable.

223
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,939
But if the electrical force
is flowing through the wire,

224
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,940
why does the needle

225
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,442
not move in
the same direction,

226
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,476
parallel
to the wire?

227
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,478
Quite.

228
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:03,015
Let's try turning
the whole apparatus round.

229
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,821
Again, Newman.

230
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,763
So, the electrical force goes
this way.

231
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,800
The compass points that way.

232
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,701
How can one affect the other?

233
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,736
( utters sound )

234
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,040
Perhaps the electricity
is throwing out

235
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,208
some invisible force

236
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,309
as it moves
along.

237
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,343
What?

238
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:35,414
Perhaps some sort of electrical
force is emanating

239
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,016
outwards from
the wire.

240
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,417
Oh, my dear boy, let me tell you

241
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,653
that at
the University of Cambridge,

242
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,088
electricity flows
through a wire,

243
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,723
not sideways to it.

244
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,225
That may be
what they teach
at Cambridge,

245
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,993
but it doesn't explain
what's happening

246
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,994
before our eyes.

247
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,462
No, now, let's just get on.

248
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,898
Let's swap the compass
to below the wire.

249
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,602
LITHGOW:
Why the compass was deflected
at right angles,

250
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,438
why the electricity was
affecting the compass at all,

251
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,042
dumbfounded Davy
and many others.

252
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,848
MINISTER:
As we celebrate the marriage
of Michael and Sarah...

253
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,352
LITHGOW:
For Faraday, however,
the problem became an obsession.

254
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,522
It was a fascination
inspired by his religion.

255
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,724
For him, the problem was a way

256
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:21,994
to understand God's
hidden mysteries.

257
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,699
BODANIS:
There is a small, almost
persecuted group in London

258
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,933
called the Sandemanians.

259
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,802
They were a religious...
not really a sect,

260
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,104
they were just a small subset,
sort of like Quakers.

261
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,773
Faraday was a member
of that group.

262
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,408
It was a very gentle,
decent group.

263
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,211
They believed that underneath
the whole surface of reality,

264
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,814
everything was created by God
in a unified way;

265
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,816
that if you opened up
one little part of it,

266
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,951
you could see
how everything was connected.

267
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,557
Michael Faraday was someone

268
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,827
who, like Einstein, thought
in terms of pictures.

269
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,698
BODANIS:
Faraday was different
from anybody else.

270
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,534
He had a flair for understanding
his experiments,

271
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,170
for understanding what was
really going on inside them.

272
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,942
LITHGOW:
By methodically placing
a compass

273
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,543
all around an electrified wire,

274
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,246
Faraday started
to notice a pattern.

275
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,555
What everyone else at the time
had been taught

276
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,424
was that forces travel
in straight lines.

277
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,993
Faraday was different.

278
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,262
Faraday imagined
that invisible lines of force

279
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,997
flowed around an electric wire.

280
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,167
And then he imagined

281
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,436
that a magnet had similar lines
emerging from it

282
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,972
and that those lines would get
caught up in this flow.

283
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,374
It was a bit
like a flag in a wind.

284
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,381
LITHGOW:
But Faraday's great leap
of imagination

285
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,518
was to turn this experiment
on its head.

286
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,955
Instead of an electrified wire
moving a compass needle,

287
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,592
he wondered if he could get
a static magnet to move a wire.

288
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,361
I've never seen you
like this, Faraday.

289
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,764
( chuckling ):
You look like
a happy child.

290
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,701
I'm shaking, Newman.

291
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,569
Underneath, I'm shaking.

292
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,144
( gasps )

293
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,245
You see, John?

294
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,314
You see?

295
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,048
Yes.

296
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,330
GATES:
This is the experiment
of the century.

297
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,933
It's the invention
of the electric motor.

298
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,569
Scale up the magnets
and the wires,

299
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,439
make them really big,
attach heavy weights to them

300
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,009
and they'll be dragged along.

301
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,877
But almost more importantly,

302
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,680
he's inventing
a new kind of physics here.

303
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,417
LITHGOW:
Although he didn't realize it
at the time,

304
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,520
Faraday had also
just demonstrated

305
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,789
an overarching principle.

306
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,657
The chemicals in the battery

307
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,761
had been transformed
into electricity in the wire,

308
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:13,932
which had combined with
the magnet to produce motion.

309
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:19,772
Behind all these various forces
there was a common energy.

310
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,851
BODANIS:
A couple of months earlier,

311
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,621
Davy had been elected president
of the Royal Society,

312
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,991
which was the elite body
of English science.

313
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,726
But then he saw
this great discovery

314
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,995
published in the Quarterly
Journal of Science.

315
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,396
I don't know if he was envious,

316
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,298
but he certainly saw
that this young man

317
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,234
who had been his assistant,
this mere blacksmith's son,

318
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,537
had come up with one
of the greatest discoveries

319
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,105
of the Victorian era.

320
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:04,416
Davy accuses Faraday
of plagiarizing similar work

321
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,587
from another eminent British
scientist, William Wollaston.

322
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:12,357
So, Faraday, what
does Wollaston
make of all this?

323
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,693
He's written to me
and assures me

324
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,261
that he's taken
no offense,

325
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,197
and he acknowledges
that what I published

326
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,832
was entirely my own work.

327
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:20,899
Quite, quite.

328
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,502
Davy is just
being an ass.

329
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,771
But will Davy now retract
his allegation?

330
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,005
Sadly, no.

331
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,907
In fact, he is still
vehemently opposed

332
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,742
to you being elected
a member of the society.

333
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,945
Really. And what do you think?

334
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,582
Faraday, my dear boy,
you have my vote.

335
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,716
And mine.

336
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,785
And I believe you
even have Wollaston's.

337
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,454
Oh... What a mess!

338
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,022
Well, no matter,
no matter--

339
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,524
it's the science
that counts.

340
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,558
So, tell me,

341
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,894
how does this wire
of yours spin
round its magnet?

342
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,030
What mysterious
forces are at play?

343
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:57,636
There seems to be
an electromagnetic interaction.

344
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,305
In my mind, I see
a swirling array

345
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,207
of lines of force spinning

346
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,276
out of
the electrified wire

347
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,646
like a spiraling web.

348
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,148
But invisible
lines of force--

349
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,316
it's all a bit vague,
isn't it?

350
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,886
Faraday, might I have
a word in private?

351
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,622
Certainly.

352
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,968
Listen, Faraday,

353
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,503
let's stop
this nonsense.

354
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,672
I want you
to take down
your ballot paper

355
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,773
from the notice board.

356
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,076
Sir Humphry, I see
no reason to take it down.

357
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,979
My friends have
proposed me.

358
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,748
It is they
who put the paper up.

359
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,416
I will not take it down.

360
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,450
Good day.

361
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,560
LITHGOW:
Faraday was elected
to the Royal Society.

362
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,095
Davy died five years later,

363
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,899
a victim of his
many gaseous inhalations.

364
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,570
In time, Faraday's world
of invisible forces would lead

365
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,739
to a whole new
understanding of energy.

366
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:12,644
He'd started what Einstein would
call the great revolution.

367
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:24,389
It was in the very heart of this
exciting new world of energy

368
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,858
that Einstein grew up.

369
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,272
EINSTEIN:
My father and uncle wanted
to make their fortune

370
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,408
by bringing electric light
to the streets of Germany.

371
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,914
From an early age,
I loved to look at machines,

372
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,416
understand how things work.

373
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,888
He's going to kill himself.

374
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,827
Albert, stay there.

375
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:11,603
( man scolding in background )

376
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:17,276
EINSTEIN:
I experienced a miracle when
my father showed me a compass.

377
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,112
I trembled and grew cold.

378
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:26,451
There had to be something behind
objects that lay deeply hidden.

379
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,794
At high school, they had their
ideas about what I should learn.

380
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,162
I had my own.

381
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,497
Einstein!

382
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,366
EINSTEIN:
I was merely interested
in physics, maths, philosophy

383
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,535
and playing the violin.

384
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,138
Everything else was a bore.

385
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,139
Einstein!

386
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,707
On your feet!

387
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,213
As you obviously
know everything

388
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,816
about geology,
tell me,

389
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,219
how do the rock strata run here?

390
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:04,356
It's pretty much the same to me

391
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,391
whichever way they run,
Herr Professor.

392
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,601
LITHGOW:
Einstein's teachers tried
to drum into him,

393
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,337
as Faraday had shown,

394
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,174
that energy could be converted
from one form into another.

395
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,876
They also believed
that all forms of energy

396
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,578
had already been discovered.

397
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:30,182
Einstein was going
to prove them wrong.

398
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,652
He would discover a new,
vast reservoir of energy,

399
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,855
hidden where no other scientist
had ever thought of looking--

400
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,859
deep in the heart of matter.

401
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,741
A hundred years
before Einstein's birth,

402
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,144
King Louis XV was
on the throne of France.

403
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,481
But the ancient, absolute power
of the monarchy over the people

404
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,182
was starting to be challenged.

405
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,784
MAN:Jacques,

406
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:06,651
leave the windows.

407
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,153
Forget the rain.

408
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,121
We need air.

409
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,627
LITHGOW:
The French Revolution was
just around the corner.

410
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,596
( thunder rumbles )

411
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,866
WOMAN:
This was the era
of enlightenment,

412
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,169
when intellectuals
believed very firmly

413
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,471
that the way forward
lay in science.

414
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,507
And they felt that
one of the first tasks

415
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,675
that lay ahead of them
was to rationalize

416
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:33,545
and to classify
every single kind of matter

417
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,082
so they could see how it
all interacted together.

418
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:41,486
LITHGOW:
Antoine Lavoisier, a wealthy,
aristocratic young man,

419
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,221
decided to take up this task,

420
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,157
to see if there was
some basic connection

421
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,893
between all the stuff
of everyday life:

422
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,196
all the different substances
in the world.

423
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:59,304
But what worked for Lavoisier
as a scientist--

424
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,908
his meticulous, even obsessive
attention to detail--

425
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,710
was also to be his downfall.

426
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:12,384
Monsieur Lavoisier, you are,
if my eyes do not deceive me,

427
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,286
consuming only milk
this evening.

428
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,521
First you had a glass of milk,

429
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,224
now you are eating
a bowl of milk.

430
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,260
Will you next move on
to a plate of milk?

431
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,261
( chortles )

432
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,529
LAVOISIER:
Your precise observations

433
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,966
commend you as a lady
of scientific curiosity,

434
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,034
Mademoiselle.

435
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,168
Most unusual.

436
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,436
As you seek knowledge,

437
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,938
so I shall dispense it.

438
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:37,976
For the last five weeks,
I have taken nothing but milk.

439
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,278
MAN:
Good God, man,

440
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,080
I would rather die than fast

441
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,949
on milk
for five weeks!

442
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,985
Are you in the grip
of some horrendous ailment?

443
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,753
On the contrary.

444
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,623
I am investigating the effects

445
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,925
of diet on health.

446
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,660
MAN:
Monsieur, with the
greatest of respect

447
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,597
to a member of the Royal
Academy of Sciences,

448
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:02,901
your gut must think
your throat has been slit!

449
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,003
( laughs loudly )

450
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:09,140
( laughter spreads )

451
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,777
Whereas your gut, Count, is
no doubt petitioning the Academy

452
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,013
for a widening
of your throat.

453
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,014
WOMAN ( gasping ):
Marie Anne!

454
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,616
How dare you

455
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,618
insult
the count?

456
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,489
Don't forget what
the count offers...

457
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,294
not just marriage,
but think

458
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,695
of how you will be introduced

459
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,596
to all the salons.

460
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,599
You will be

461
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,101
the toast of Paris.

462
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,005
LAVOISIER:
Would it not be
a shame, Madame,

463
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,840
to burden you

464
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,944
with the duties of matrimony
before you have had a chance

465
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,313
to experience
your curiosity for nature?

466
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,251
Shall we all go through?

467
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,388
It's getting rather hot in here.

468
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,598
Do you really plan
to marry d'Amerval?

469
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,567
There is a plan,
but it is not mine.

470
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,435
Then I must contrive
to save you.

471
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:20,145
LITHGOW:
Lavoisier wasn't a scientist
by profession.

472
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:23,014
He was the head of tax
enforcement in Paris.

473
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:27,052
His great idea was to build
a huge wall around the city

474
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,055
and to tax everything
that came and went.

475
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,191
But his taxes on the simple
things in life--

476
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,393
bread, wine and cheese--

477
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,530
did not endear him
to the average Parisian.

478
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,866
This scrupulous,
fastidious young man

479
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:47,072
did still allow himself
the occasional act of passion.

480
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:54,179
In 1771, Lavoisier married
Marie Anne Paulze,

481
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,616
the daughter of his colleague
in the tax office.

482
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,120
Thus he saved her,
as he had promised,

483
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,591
from an arranged marriage
to a count 40 years her elder.

484
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,798
Allow me to show
you something.

485
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,007
FARA:
Lavoisier, I think, found
his job as a tax collector

486
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,308
really rather tedious,

487
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,044
and the times he looked
forward to were the evenings

488
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,580
and the weekends, when
he could indulge his passion

489
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,849
for chemical experimentation.

490
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,752
And he called those times
his jours de bonheur,

491
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,086
his days of happiness.

492
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,757
Madame.

493
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:49,668
What will happen if I take a bar
of copper or iron

494
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,568
and leave it outside

495
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,038
in the rain
for months on end,

496
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,573
Madame Lavoisier?

497
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,641
Mmm...

498
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,777
( giggles ):
Monsieur Lavoisier?

499
00:27:58,777 --> 00:27:59,511
The metals--

500
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,880
what will become of them?

501
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,483
Is this a verbal
examination

502
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:09,254
prior to an examination
proper, sir?

503
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,756
I merely seek the truth.

504
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,525
Then you toy with me,
monsieur,

505
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,560
for you know the truth.

506
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,097
The copper will become covered
in a green verdigris,

507
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,466
and the iron will rust.

508
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,635
I believe the term is

509
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,770
calcined.

510
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,973
Most impressive,
my charming wife.

511
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,308
But let me press
you further.

512
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,509
Hmm?

513
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:35,313
When the metal rusts,
does it get heavier

514
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,681
or lighter?

515
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,884
Why, sir, I think
you mean to trap me.

516
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,086
Oh.

517
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,189
Then perhaps this little
butterfly should land

518
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,524
and allow me to take
a closer look.

519
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:50,929
Every last citizen in France
of sensible age knows

520
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,897
that when a metal rusts,
it wastes away,

521
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,100
it gets lighter
and eventually
disappears.

522
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,101
Ah, but...

523
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,569
Ah, stop.

524
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,537
I have not finished.

525
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,639
Contain yourself, sir.

526
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,808
There is more.

527
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:07,045
In a recently published pamphlet

528
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,880
by a brilliant
young chemist,

529
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,282
Antoine Lavoisier
demonstrates

530
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,685
that the iron combines
with the air.

531
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,720
It, in fact, becomes heavier.

532
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,956
Most impressive.

533
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:18,923
I intend...

534
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,493
Now, whatever you
intend, monsieur,

535
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,795
I intend to be
by your side.

536
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,530
I will learn all I can
about your science

537
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,465
and become your
worthy colleague.

538
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,869
Then let me show you
how the iron combines
with the air

539
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,371
to form such
a delicate union.

540
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,807
Tomorrow, monsieur.

541
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,842
Tomorrow.

542
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,727
LITHGOW:
Marie Anne learned chemistry
at her husband's side,

543
00:29:55,727 --> 00:30:00,932
but soon sought other ways
to contribute to his work.

544
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,133
She learned English

545
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:06,070
so that she could translate
contemporary scientific works.

546
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,172
She took drawing lessons

547
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,241
so that she could record
in forensic detail

548
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,344
the minutiae of their work
together.

549
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,547
She ran their laboratory

550
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:19,384
and was the public face
of Lavoisier, Inc.

551
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,320
She was central
to the whole research effort.

552
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,190
Monsieur,

553
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,192
that is a terrible thing to say.

554
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,226
( giggles )

555
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,661
You are a cheeky man.

556
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,129
( both laugh )

557
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,931
LAVOISIER:
This way, please, gentlemen.

558
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,575
Messieurs...

559
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,545
it is my great ambition

560
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:53,952
to demonstrate
that nature is a closed system,

561
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,887
that in any transformation,

562
00:30:55,887 --> 00:31:01,292
no amount of matter, no mass
is ever lost

563
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,461
and none is gained.

564
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,662
Over here, please.

565
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:16,641
This precise amount of water
is heated to steam.

566
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,176
This steam is brought
into contact

567
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:23,982
with a red-hot iron barrel
imbedded in the coals.

568
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,320
From this end we cool the steam

569
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:36,127
but, interestingly, we collect
less water than we started with.

570
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:41,232
So clearly we lose
a certain amount of water.

571
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,937
However, we also collect a gas,

572
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,807
and the weight
of the iron barrel increases.

573
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,413
Now, when we combine
these two increases--

574
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,848
the new weight
of the iron barrel

575
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,183
and the gas we have collected--

576
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:05,590
they are exactly equal to
the weight of the lost water.

577
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,492
Ah, but is it

578
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,761
atmospheric air,
Monsieur Lavoisier?

579
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,029
No.

580
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,332
No, because I am measuring it
to the very last grain,

581
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,835
I can see that it is lighter
than the air around us

582
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,070
and, moreover...

583
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,108
it is flammable.

584
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:26,811
( whoosh and pop )

585
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:27,845
Voil.

586
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,650
BODANIS:
Water is made out of hydrogen
and oxygen.

587
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,552
So what he had done is
get the oxygen to stick

588
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,755
to the inside
of a red-hot iron rifle barrel.

589
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,325
He was basically just making
rust, which is oxygen and iron,

590
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,160
but he was making the rust
really quickly.

591
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,029
Now, that left the hydrogen,
what he called combustible air,

592
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,597
and that was just floating
around as a gas.

593
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,099
( whoosh and pop )

594
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,767
No mass had been lost.

595
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,269
It had merely been transformed,

596
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,872
and now he wanted to transform
it all back into water.

597
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,580
This is only the beginning.

598
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,148
In the next few months
I hope to demonstrate

599
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:09,153
that I can recombine this
combustible air with vital air

600
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,290
and transform them both
back into water.

601
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,994
I will re-create exactly
the same amount of water

602
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,929
that was lost here
in this process.

603
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:24,102
It is my hope
to complete the cycle--

604
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:29,173
water into gas into water...

605
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,443
and not a drop lost.

606
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,648
For a long time,
Lavoisier had suspected

607
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,183
that the exact amount of matter,
the mass

608
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,587
involved in any transformation
was always conserved.

609
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,756
But to prove this,

610
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,291
he had to perform thousands
of experiments,

611
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,626
and he had to do
the measurements

612
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,395
with incredible accuracy.

613
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,498
That's where his great wealth

614
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,366
from being a tax collector
came in.

615
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,435
He could afford to commission

616
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,104
the most sensitive instruments
ever built.

617
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,842
He became
obsessed with accuracy.

618
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:15,053
LITHGOW:
But Lavoisier's exacting methods
were also starting to anger

619
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,889
the growing mob of hungry,
disenchanted Parisians.

620
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,458
( people yelling )

621
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,194
MARIE ANNE:
Antoine.

622
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,462
Antoine.

623
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,830
Oh, wake up, Antoine.

624
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,902
I'm sorry.

625
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,138
What time is it?

626
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,874
It is almost time
to receive Monsieur Marat.

627
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,042
The Academy asked you

628
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,978
to assess his designs.

629
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:44,348
He claims to have made
a great discovery.

630
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,584
Oh, Antoine, have you forgotten?

631
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,586
Oh, God.

632
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,689
Another charlatan
with an idea to peddle.

633
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,424
God, give me patience.

634
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:01,732
( Lavoisier coughs )

635
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,535
Ah, Monsieur Marat.

636
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:05,903
Monsieur.

637
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,972
I have invented
a device

638
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,440
which projects
an image

639
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,376
of the substance of fire
onto a screen.

640
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,745
You see,

641
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:19,250
when a lantern is
shone through a flame,

642
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,253
we see a shimmering pattern
above the flame.

643
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,855
My device renders

644
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:27,792
the substance of fire visible.

645
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,429
Have you collected it,
this substance of fire?

646
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,564
Have you trapped it
and measured it?

647
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,867
Well, no, but...

648
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,136
but one can see it.

649
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,971
I'm sorry.

650
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,772
In the absence
of exact measurements,

651
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,941
of precise observations,

652
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:45,910
without rigorous reasoning,

653
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,712
one can only be engaging
in conjecture,

654
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,647
so this is not science.

655
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,083
I am not given

656
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,252
to conjecture, monsieur.

657
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,020
No, no.

658
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,321
If you will you excuse me.

659
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,890
I am extremely busy today.

660
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,825
Thank you.

661
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,727
Thank you.

662
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,061
So that is all?

663
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,632
Then good day, monsieur!

664
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,606
( slams on table )

665
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,321
Let me guess, Marat.

666
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,157
The king's
scientific despot
has decreed

667
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,625
that your invention
does not conform

668
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,527
to the version
of the truth

669
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:40,498
as laid down
by the Academy.

670
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,267
Lavoisier.

671
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:47,305
He talks about facts,
he worships the truth.

672
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,941
Listen to me, my friend.

673
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,843
They are all the same,
the Royal Academies--

674
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,046
they insult the liberty
of the mind.

675
00:36:56,814 --> 00:37:01,819
They think they are
the sole arbiters of genius.

676
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,488
They are rotten
to the core--

677
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:09,527
just like every other
tentacle of the king.

678
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:15,466
The people-- it is they
who will determine
right and wrong.

679
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:16,734
Don't worry.

680
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:22,540
In my next pamphlet
I will expose this
persecutor of yours.

681
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,587
LITHGOW:
For years, the Lavoisiers
burned, chopped, melted

682
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,357
and boiled every conceivable
substance.

683
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,592
They'd shown that
as long as one is scrupulous

684
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,762
about collecting all the vapors,
liquids and powders

685
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:49,734
created in a transformation,
then mass is not decreased.

686
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,504
Liquids might become gases,
metals may rust,

687
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,207
wood may become ash and smoke,

688
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:00,578
but matter, the tiny atoms
that make up all substances,

689
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,747
none of it is ever lost.

690
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,983
The crowning glory
of this opus was

691
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,953
their remarkable use
of static electricity

692
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:14,025
to cause oxygen and hydrogen
to recombine back into water.

693
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,168
What is happening?

694
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:31,909
( explosions in distance )

695
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,917
LITHGOW:
As the French Revolution
exploded,

696
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,654
the royal family
and whole swaths of aristocrats

697
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,358
lost their heads
on the guillotine.

698
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,898
FARA:
To the French revolutionaries
of 1790,

699
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,500
Lavoisier meant one thing
and one thing only:

700
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,570
he was the despised
tax collector

701
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,339
who'd built that wall
around Paris.

702
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,675
LITHGOW:
Lavoisier's job
as a tax collector

703
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,544
brought him under suspicion.

704
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,611
He was denounced

705
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,215
by a failed scientist
turned radical journalist,

706
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,484
Jean Paul Marat.

707
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,293
( pounding at door )

708
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,466
( pounding at door )

709
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,501
( knocking at door )

710
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,137
Ouest Lavoisier?
Je ne sais pas.

711
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,338
Lavoisier!

712
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,340
Lavoisier!

713
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,091
Lavoisier!

714
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:16,213
( sobbing )

715
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:35,766
( crowd yelling )

716
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,269
( crowd cheering )

717
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,737
BODANIS:
What Lavoisier did

718
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,439
was absolutely central
to science

719
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,140
and especially
to E equals m c-squared.

720
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,376
Because what he said is,
if you take a bunch of matter,

721
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,512
you can break it apart,
you can recombine it,

722
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,613
you can do anything to it

723
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,883
and the stuff of the matter
won't go away.

724
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,953
If the mob burned Paris
to the ground, utterly razed it,

725
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,055
shattered the bricks
into rubble and dust

726
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,591
and burned the buildings
into ashes and smoke,

727
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,427
it turns out if you put
a huge dome over Paris

728
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,529
and weighed all the smoke
and all the ashes

729
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,764
and all the rubble,

730
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:10,301
it would add up to the exact
same weight as the original city

731
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,902
and the air around it before.

732
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:14,038
Nothing disappears.

733
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,961
LITHGOW:
A century later, all of nature
had been classified

734
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,763
into two great domains.

735
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,467
There was energy-- the forces
that animated objects;

736
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,369
and there was mass--

737
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,539
the physical stuff
that made up those objects.

738
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,542
The whole of 19th-century
science rested

739
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,111
on these two mighty pillars.

740
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:58,983
The laws that governed one
did not apply to the other.

741
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:03,220
But young, newly enrolled
physics student Albert Einstein

742
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,589
didn't like laws.

743
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:06,891
Good grief,
Einstein.

744
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,659
What happened
to you?

745
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,394
It is more
than a little
ironic,

746
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,830
having been
reprimanded
yesterday

747
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,266
by that idiot
Professor Pernet
for poor attendance,

748
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,501
that I should in fact attend
a practical lesson

749
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,336
which was as long
as it was boring,

750
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,971
and utterly pointless,
by the way,

751
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,107
only to be the victim
of an explosion

752
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,508
of my own apparatus.

753
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,509
It was your own fault, then?

754
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,878
Thank you.

755
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,748
And how are you today,
Fraulein Maric?

756
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,149
Extremely well, Herr Einstein.

757
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,284
All the better for seeing

758
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,786
you have escaped the physics
laboratory with your life.

759
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:40,524
Well, in order not to alarm
you any further, I pledge

760
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,193
to forever continue my studies
here at the Cafe Bahnhof,

761
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,896
reading only the great masters
of theoretical physics

762
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,866
and eschewing the babbling
nonsense of the polytechnicians.

763
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,067
( chuckles )

764
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,669
That's about
all you ever do.

765
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:56,040
It's getting a little stuffy
in here, Fraulein Maric.

766
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,243
Would you care to take
a walk with me?

767
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,312
There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

768
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,882
Why, Herr Einstein...

769
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,383
of course.

770
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,487
Perhaps you'd like
me to tell you

771
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:14,058
what you have missed
in lectures this week?

772
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,700
MAN:
Einstein wasn't exactly
a model student.

773
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,736
He excelled in certain subjects,
especially physics and math,

774
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,439
but he wasn't very diligent
in a lot of his other classes.

775
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,242
He was undoubtedly
very questioning,

776
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,645
which seems to have annoyed
most of his professors

777
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,646
throughout his life.

778
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,381
He would pursue his fascinations

779
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,116
with just incredible
determination.

780
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,754
MAN:
We know from his letters

781
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,056
that Einstein,
even from the age of 16,

782
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:50,027
was literally obsessed
with the nature of light.

783
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,934
Everyone he could speak to--
his friends, his colleagues,

784
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:59,903
even his then girlfriend,
Mileva Maric,

785
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,206
who would become his wife--

786
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,676
everyone he badgered with
the question: what is light?

787
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,147
( laughing )

788
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:17,154
What would I see
if I rode on a beam of light?

789
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,689
What?

790
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,225
A beam of light?

791
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:24,928
By what method do you propose
to ride on this beam of light?

792
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,997
The method is not important.

793
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,399
Let us just imagine
we two are

794
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,767
( loudly ):
young...

795
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:30,934
Shh!

796
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:34,938
( loudly still ):
radical, bohemian experimenters,

797
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:39,343
hand-in-hand,
on a journey to the outer
reaches of the universe,

798
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,714
and we are riding on
the front of a wave of light.

799
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,082
( laughs )

800
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:45,983
I really don't know

801
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,052
what you are suggesting,
Herr Einstein.

802
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,387
Do you wish to hold my
hand or ridicule me?

803
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:51,388
Ridicule you?

804
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:52,489
No, never.

805
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,162
I merely want you
to help me to understand.

806
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,832
What would we see,
do you think...

807
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,067
Um...

808
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:09,073
if we were together
and we sped up... and up

809
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:13,610
until we caught up
to the front of
a beam of light?

810
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,191
LITHGOW:
It was Einstein's relentless
pursuit of light

811
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,993
which would bring about
a revolution in science.

812
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,731
With light he would reinvent
the universe

813
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,966
and find a hidden pathway

814
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:39,837
that would unite
energy and mass.

815
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:50,881
Light moves incredibly fast,
670 million miles per hour.

816
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,884
That's why scientists use
the term c.

817
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:59,123
It stands for celeritas--
Latin for swiftness.

818
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:14,004
Long before the 19th century,

819
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,740
scientists had computed
the speed of light,

820
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:21,211
but no one knew
what light actually was.

821
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:24,915
Back in England, a man we've
already met was willing to make

822
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:29,253
an educated guess.

823
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,288
After Sir Humphry Davy's death,

824
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,324
Michael Faraday became
Professor Faraday,

825
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:37,795
one of the most important
experimenters in the world.

826
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,033
The scientific establishment
still found it hard to accept

827
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:46,203
that electricity and magnetism
were just two aspects

828
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,771
of the same phenomenon,

829
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:52,276
which Faraday called
electromagnetism.

830
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,544
But now he has

831
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:58,415
an even more outrageous proposal
for his audience.

832
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:06,990
Invisible lines
that can emanate

833
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,459
from electricity in a wire,

834
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:14,598
from a magnet
or... even from the sun.

835
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,667
( crowd laughs )

836
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,237
For it is my contention

837
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:27,811
that light itself is just one
form of these vibrating lines

838
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,514
of electromagnetism.

839
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,782
( laughter )

840
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:35,619
LITHGOW:
For 15 years, Faraday struggled
to convince the skeptics

841
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,322
that light was
an electromagnetic wave,

842
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:42,860
but he lacked the advanced
mathematics to back up his idea.

843
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,263
Eventually, someone came
to his rescue.

844
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,836
Professor James Clerk Maxwell
believed

845
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,972
in Faraday's far-sighted vision,

846
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,375
and he had the mathematical
skill to prove it.

847
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:10,721
Maxwell and the aging Faraday
became close friends.

848
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,795
James.

849
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:20,998
James, forgive me.

850
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,267
( gasps )

851
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,669
A word of advice:
don't get old.

852
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,004
( chuckles )

853
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,372
Michael, how are you?

854
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,706
Oh, I'm fine.

855
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:32,342
Memory isn't too good,
but...

856
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,311
Well, I thought
you might like to see

857
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,545
what I've just published.

858
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:36,613
Oh, yes, yes.

859
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,519
Splendid.

860
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:51,662
So your results show that when
electricity flows along a wire,

861
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:55,265
what it actually does is create
a little bit of magnetism.

862
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,201
Now, as that magnetic
charge moves,

863
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,771
it creates a little piece
of electricity.

864
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,372
Electricity.

865
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,442
Electricity and magnetism
are interwoven,

866
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,078
like a... a never-ending braid.

867
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,180
So it is always pulsing forward.

868
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,550
That's wonderful.

869
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,620
Wonderful.

870
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,123
Michael.

871
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,527
Michael, there's
something very crucial
in maths.

872
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,429
This electricity
producing magnetism

873
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,364
and magnetism
producing electricity--

874
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,067
it can only ever happen
at a very particular speed.

875
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,903
The equations are
very clear about it.

876
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:36,239
They come up
with just one number:

877
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,410
670 million miles per hour.

878
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,713
I'm not sure I...?

879
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,115
That's the speed of light.

880
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,751
That is the speed of light!

881
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,087
Well, that means you
were right all along.

882
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:54,024
Light is
an electromagnetic wave.

883
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,998
LITHGOW:
Maxwell had proven Faraday
right.

884
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:06,837
Electricity and magnetism
are just two aspects

885
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:11,408
of a deeper unity, a force
now called electromagnetism,

886
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:15,379
which travels
at 670 million miles per hour.

887
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:22,352
In its visible form, it is
nothing other than light itself.

888
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:29,226
And nothing fascinated the young
Einstein more than light.

889
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:33,430
( playing light romantic piece )

890
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,479
( sighs )

891
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,381
We have lectures
in half an hour.

892
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,649
Oh, let me think.

893
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:55,118
Professor Weber and his
life-draining monologue

894
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,654
or you... ( kisses )

895
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:01,725
Mozart and James Clerk Maxwell?

896
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,726
We can't.

897
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,727
We'll get a warning.

898
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,228
Our project
is too precious

899
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,364
to waste time listening
to those dullards.

900
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,532
Come with me,

901
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,467
we'll read Maxwell

902
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,270
and think about
the electromagnetic theory
of light!

903
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,538
( giggling )

904
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,007
Oh, why, my dear
little Johnnie,

905
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,509
how you enchant a lady.

906
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:44,534
MARIC:
She's very pretty.

907
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:52,175
Yes, but can she
soar and dance like
our dark souls do?

908
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,444
( sighs )

909
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,915
BODANIS:
Maxwell's equations contained
an incredible prediction.

910
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:02,052
They said you could never
catch up to a beam of light.

911
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:05,755
Even if you were traveling
at 670 million miles an hour,

912
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,191
you would still see light
squiggle away from you

913
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,926
at 670 million miles an hour.

914
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:15,098
Do you see how she stares
at that wave?

915
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,600
Yes.

916
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,201
You see how for her
it is static?

917
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,236
Yes.

918
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:23,440
She and the wave are traveling
at the same speed.

919
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,310
We see the wave moving
through the water.

920
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,947
But relative to her,
it just sits there.

921
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:33,250
So is light like that?

922
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,453
Common sense would say that if
you caught up to a light beam,

923
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:40,390
there would be a wave of light
just sitting there.

924
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,791
Maybe it would be shimmering,

925
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,927
a bit of electricity
and a bit of magnetism.

926
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:47,664
So if she was traveling
alongside the light wave,

927
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,732
it wouldn't be moving.

928
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:49,766
It would be static.

929
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:53,670
But Maxwell says
you can't have static light.

930
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,038
Maybe Maxwell is wrong.

931
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,973
Maybe if you catch up to light,

932
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:01,511
it is static, Albert,
like a wave next to a boat.

933
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,484
Imagine if I were sitting still
and holding a mirror to my face.

934
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:12,222
The light travels from my face
to the mirror and I see my face.

935
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,223
Yes.

936
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:16,693
However, if I and the mirror

937
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,430
were traveling
at the speed of light?

938
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,800
You're going at the same speed
as the light leaving your face?

939
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,468
Exactly.

940
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,338
The light never reaches
the mirror?

941
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,640
So would I be invisible?

942
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,675
Hmm.

943
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,880
That doesn't make sense.

944
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,352
LITHGOW:
Young Einstein was starting
to realize

945
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:46,089
that light was unlike
any other kind of wave.

946
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,800
Einstein was about to enter
a surreal universe

947
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,003
where energy, mass and
the speed of light intermingled

948
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,572
in a way no one
had ever suspected.

949
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,109
But there was one last
mathematical ingredient

950
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,811
that Einstein would need:

951
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:11,715
the everyday process
of squaring.

952
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,028
Long before
the French Revolution,

953
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:28,999
scientists were not sure how
to quantify motion.

954
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,100
Challenge.

955
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,870
LITHGOW:
Equations that explained

956
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,373
how objects moved and collided
were in their infancy.

957
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:37,374
( growls )

958
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,075
( kisses and giggles )

959
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,214
LITHGOW:
A crucial contribution
to this subject

960
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:47,017
would come
from an unusual source.

961
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:54,624
Meet the aristocratic
16-year-old daughter

962
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:59,296
of one of King Louis XIV's
courtiers, Emilie du Chtelet.

963
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,931
( both grunting )

964
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,770
( groaning )
( giggling )

965
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,075
Quickly, Father
is coming!

966
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,948
LITHGOW:
Emilie du Chtelet would have
a huge effect on physics

967
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,052
in her tragically short
lifetime.

968
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,321
Unheard of for a woman
of her time,

969
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,823
she would publish
many scientific works,

970
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,794
including a translation
of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia,

971
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:33,730
the greatest treatise on motion
ever written.

972
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:37,167
Du Chtelet's translation
is still

973
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,937
the standard text in France
today.

974
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:44,708
Musa, mihi
causas memora...

975
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,043
Muse, my memory causes...

976
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,813
O Muse! The causes
and the crimes relate

977
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,849
What goddess was provoked,
and whence her hate

978
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,151
For what offence
the Queen of Heaven began

979
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,955
To persecute so brave,
so just a man!

980
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,590
Do not be cross
with your sister,

981
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,826
because she persecutes
many a just man!

982
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:03,827
Only the other night,

983
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,296
Emilie silenced
the duc du Luynes

984
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:09,833
when she divided a ridiculously
long number in her head

985
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:10,900
in a matter of seconds.

986
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,303
You should have seen the
incredulity on their faces

987
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,672
when they realized Emilie
was correct.

988
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:18,608
Was it my sister's
astounding intelligence

989
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,043
or her boundless beauty

990
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,878
that made their mouths gape,
I wonder?

991
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,314
Ah well, yes, you have
a point, monsieur.

992
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,716
Messieurs, I thank you
for your kindness.

993
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,453
I fear, however,
that my wit is only
a curiosity to others.

994
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,390
If only my mind were
permitted opportunity.

995
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,158
My dearest Emilie.

996
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,961
You are blessed
with intellect and courage.

997
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,498
Use them both and the world
will fall at your feet.

998
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,732
No...

999
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,138
WOMAN:
In one sense,

1000
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,341
she is a woman utterly out of
her true time and place.

1001
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,643
She's a philosopher,
a scientist,

1002
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,446
a mathematician,
a linguist.

1003
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:57,680
She demands a freedom

1004
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,550
that women didn't begin to enjoy
until over 150 years later--

1005
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,685
a freedom to study science,

1006
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:06,289
to write about it,
and to be published.

1007
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:13,863
LITHGOW:
Du Chtelet married a general
in the French army at age 19

1008
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:15,665
and had three children.

1009
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,333
She ran a busy household,

1010
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,637
all the while pursuing
her passion for science.

1011
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:24,741
She was 23 when she discovered
advanced mathematics.

1012
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,676
She enthusiastically
took lessons

1013
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,112
from one of the greatest
mathematicians of the day,

1014
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,548
Pierre de Maupertuis.

1015
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,416
He was an expert on Newton,

1016
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:35,985
and she was his eager
young student;

1017
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,121
it seems they had
a brief affair.

1018
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:42,358
But then he set off
on a polar expedition.

1019
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,928
Du Chtelet then fell
passionately in love

1020
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:48,598
with Voltaire,
France's greatest poet.

1021
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,468
A fierce critic of the king
and the Catholic Church,

1022
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,970
Voltaire had been in prison
twice

1023
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,472
and exiled to England,

1024
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,142
where he became enthralled
by the ideas of Newton.

1025
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,210
Back in France,

1026
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,713
it wasn't long before he again
insulted the king.

1027
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:08,551
Du Chtelet hid him
in her country home.

1028
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,987
The poor little creature
is devoted to him.

1029
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,424
LITHGOW:
Isolated far from Paris,
du Chtelet and Voltaire

1030
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:18,561
turned her chateau into a
palace of learning and culture,

1031
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,164
complete with
its own tiny theater,

1032
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:25,668
and all with the apparent
blessing of her husband.

1033
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,571
FARA:
There's a great deal of myth
surrounding du Chtelet

1034
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,406
and her love life

1035
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,242
and most of it is
very exaggerated.

1036
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:35,678
But her husband did accept
Voltaire into his household,

1037
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,515
and he often went to Paris
on behalf of Voltaire;

1038
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,117
he went to his publisher
to plead Voltaire's case

1039
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,786
to keep Voltaire out of jail.

1040
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:46,589
And it is also true
that Emilie du Chtelet

1041
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:49,692
did have several affairs
of a fleeting nature.

1042
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,264
( audience applauding )

1043
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,465
Bravo! Bravo!

1044
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:58,468
ZINSSER:
She created an institution
to rival that

1045
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,104
of France's Royal
Academies of Sciences.

1046
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,773
Many of the great
philosophers, poets

1047
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,276
and scientists of the day
visited.

1048
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:12,715
Ah, monsieur...
you are young.

1049
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,517
I hope that soon
you will judge me

1050
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,719
for my own merits,
or lack of them,

1051
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,821
but do not look upon me

1052
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,857
as an appendage
to this great general

1053
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:23,560
or that renowned scholar.

1054
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,261
I am in my own right

1055
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,563
a whole person,

1056
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,364
responsible
to myself alone

1057
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,366
for all that I am,

1058
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,101
all that I say...

1059
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:33,102
( blows )

1060
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:34,203
all that I do.

1061
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:40,376
LITHGOW:
Du Chtelet learned from
the brilliant men around her,

1062
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:43,012
but she quickly developed
ideas of her own.

1063
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:46,215
Much to the horror
of her mentors,

1064
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,952
she even dared to suspect
that there was a flaw

1065
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:53,856
in the great
Sir Isaac Newton's thinking.

1066
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,693
Newton stated that
the energy of an object,

1067
00:59:56,693 --> 01:00:00,163
the force with which it
collided with another object,

1068
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,831
could very simply be
accounted for

1069
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:05,602
by its mass
times its velocity.

1070
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,404
In correspondence
with scientists in Germany,

1071
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,807
du Chtelet learned
of another view,

1072
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,743
that of Gottfried Leibniz.

1073
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:17,714
He proposed that moving objects
had a kind of inner spirit.

1074
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:21,851
He called it Vis Viva,
Latin for living force.

1075
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:25,655
Many discounted his ideas,
but Leibniz was convinced

1076
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,257
that the energy of an object
was made up

1077
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:32,395
of its mass
times its velocity squared.

1078
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,834
Taking the square of something
is an ancient procedure.

1079
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,268
If you say a garden is
four square,

1080
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,270
you mean that it might be
built up

1081
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,140
by four slabs along one edge
and four along the other.

1082
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,075
So the total number of
paving slabs is

1083
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,944
four times four: 16.

1084
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,179
If the garden is eight square--
eight by eight--

1085
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,881
well, eight squared is 64.

1086
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:53,616
It'll have 64 slabs in it.

1087
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:56,319
This huge multiplication,
this building up by squares,

1088
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,621
is something you find in nature
all the time.

1089
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,791
Emilie?

1090
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,726
Emilie, you are
being absurd!

1091
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,762
Why ascribe
to an object

1092
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:09,832
a vague and
immeasurable force
like Vis Viva?

1093
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,300
It is a return
to the old ways!

1094
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,606
It is the occult!

1095
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,610
When movement commences,

1096
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,378
you say it is true
that a force is produced

1097
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:24,347
which did not exist until now.

1098
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,349
Think of our bodies--
to have free will

1099
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,384
we must be free
to initiate motion.

1100
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:29,986
So all Leibniz is asking is,

1101
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,487
where does all
this force come from?

1102
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:32,522
In your case, my dear,

1103
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,590
the force, I am sure,
is primeval.

1104
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,859
Oh! You're infuriating!

1105
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,695
You hide behind wit and sarcasm.

1106
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,264
You only think
you understand Newton.

1107
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,700
You are incapable
of understanding
Leibniz.

1108
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,301
You are a provocateur.

1109
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,303
Everything you do is
about something else

1110
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:48,838
and makes trouble
for you.

1111
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,040
Criticize this,
denounce that.

1112
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,443
Are you capable of discovering
something of your own?

1113
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,883
I discovered you!

1114
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:09,492
LITHGOW:
Despite the overwhelming support
for Newton,

1115
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:13,096
du Chtelet did not waver
in her belief.

1116
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,906
Eventually, she came across
an experiment

1117
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:27,343
performed by a Dutch scientist,
Willem 's Gravesande,

1118
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,479
that would prove her point.

1119
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:33,316
'S Gravesande in Leiden
has been dropping lead balls

1120
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,917
into a pan of clay.

1121
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,855
( sarcastically ):
Dropping lead balls into clay!

1122
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,890
How very
imaginative.

1123
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,960
DU CHATELET:
Using Newton's formulas,
Monsieur Voltaire,

1124
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,763
he then drops a second ball
from a higher height,

1125
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,098
calculated to exactly
double the speed

1126
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,367
of the first ball on impact.

1127
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:54,904
So, messieurs, care
for a little wager?

1128
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,109
Newton tells us that by doubling
the speed of the ball,

1129
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,512
we will double the distance
it travels

1130
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:03,679
into the clay.

1131
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,749
Leibniz asks us
to square that speed.

1132
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,919
If he is correct,
the ball will travel not two,

1133
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,954
but four times as far.

1134
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,090
So who is correct?

1135
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,058
Messieurs,

1136
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:19,629
I feel Mr. Newton's
reputation dwindling

1137
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,463
ever so
slightly.

1138
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,564
Oh,
Maupertuis!

1139
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,099
Do not succumb to her!

1140
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,333
There is no
earthly reason

1141
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,802
to ascribe
hidden forces

1142
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,805
to this Dutchman's
lead balls!

1143
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,373
( men laughing )

1144
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,909
Well...

1145
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:38,114
the ball travels
four times further.

1146
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,819
Turns out Leibniz is
the one who is right--

1147
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,855
it's the best way to express
the energy of a moving object.

1148
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,191
If you drive a car
at 20 miles an hour,

1149
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,693
it takes a certain distance to
stop if you slam on the brakes.

1150
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:52,261
If you're going three times
as fast--

1151
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,462
you're going 60 miles an hour--

1152
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,331
it won't take you three times
as long to stop,

1153
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:58,467
it'll take you
nine times as long to stop.

1154
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:02,171
Oh. Well... it does seem

1155
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,841
worth consideration.

1156
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,677
Perhaps we might look over
his calculations?

1157
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,879
I have already checked
his figures.

1158
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,181
I am sure Leibniz is correct
on this point.

1159
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,583
I intend
to include

1160
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,418
a section on this matter
in my book.

1161
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,987
MAUPERTUIS:
Really?

1162
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:20,890
Do be careful, madame.

1163
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:24,293
Do you think the Academy
is ready for such an opinion?

1164
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:25,294
Quite, quite.

1165
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:26,462
We really should be
careful.

1166
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,531
We?

1167
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,167
I see no reason to delay.

1168
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:34,470
There is no right time
for the truth.

1169
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,808
ZINSSER:
Emilie du Chtelet published

1170
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,843
her Institutions of Physics
in 1740,

1171
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:44,313
and it provoked
great controversy.

1172
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,319
Voltaire wrote

1173
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,091
that She was a great man whose
only fault was being a woman.

1174
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:58,461
In her day,
that was a great compliment.

1175
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,978
I am with child.

1176
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,119
You are sure?

1177
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,253
Undoubtedly.

1178
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,289
Two to three
months.

1179
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,325
I'm afraid that...

1180
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,826
You are afraid?

1181
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:32,828
You should have...

1182
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,239
Well, this child is
obviously not mine.

1183
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,245
Nor is it your husband's.

1184
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:53,916
( sighs )

1185
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,051
Oh, Emilie.

1186
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,052
Emilie.

1187
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,358
Emilie du Chtelet knew
that in the 18th century

1188
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,493
for a woman to become pregnant
at the age of 43

1189
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,062
was really very dangerous,

1190
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,630
and all the while
she was pregnant

1191
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,067
she had terrible premonitions
about what was going to happen.

1192
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,605
LITHGOW:
All her life, du Chtelet
had tried to rise above

1193
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:18,741
the limitations
placed on her gender.

1194
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:22,545
In the end, it was an affair
with a young soldier

1195
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,947
that led to her demise.

1196
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:27,883
Six days after giving birth
to her fourth child,

1197
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:30,586
she suffered an embolism
and died.

1198
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,928
Emilie du Chtelet's
conviction

1199
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:40,763
that the energy of an object

1200
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:43,366
is a function
of the square of its speed

1201
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:46,202
sparked a fierce debate.

1202
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:47,303
After her death,

1203
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:50,539
it took a hundred years
for the idea to be accepted--

1204
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:55,544
just in time for Einstein
to use this brilliant insight

1205
01:06:55,544 --> 01:07:00,116
to finally bring energy
and mass together with light.

1206
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:13,929
Einstein pursued light right
through university and beyond.

1207
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,866
Unfortunately, he'd upset
so many professors

1208
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,535
that no one would write him
a reference.

1209
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:24,940
He accepted a low-paying job
in the Swiss patent office.

1210
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:27,443
He and Mileva married
and had a child.

1211
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:29,845
The young family struggled.

1212
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:33,682
But none of it seems
to bother Albert.

1213
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,317
Einstein?

1214
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,119
I see you are busy,

1215
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,055
as usual.

1216
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,223
Look, Einstein...

1217
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,893
Albert.

1218
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:48,297
You have shown
some quite good
achievements.

1219
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,499
But, listen...

1220
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,968
About your promotion.

1221
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:54,637
I really think it would be
better to wait

1222
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,472
until you have
become more fully familiar

1223
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,874
with mechanical
engineering.

1224
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,776
I'm sorry.

1225
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:04,180
Perhaps
next time, hmm?

1226
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:09,985
MILEVA:
But I wanted to hire a maid

1227
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,688
so I can get back
and finish my degree.

1228
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:14,824
Now I will never pass
my dissertation.

1229
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,126
Oh, come, come,
my pretty little duck.

1230
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:19,562
All will be fine, you'll see.

1231
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,363
But how will it be fine,
Albert?!

1232
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:22,898
Do I have to just wait
another year

1233
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:25,401
until you are promoted?

1234
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,402
( baby crying )

1235
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,403
Come on.

1236
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:29,338
Come on, my little one.

1237
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:30,473
Oh, there we are.

1238
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:36,278
( baby continues crying )

1239
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,950
All will be fine.

1240
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,185
All will be fine, you'll see.

1241
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,556
There really is a very charming,

1242
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:50,159
but kind of a self-centered
streak to Einstein.

1243
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,061
He focuses only on
his particular obsessions.

1244
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:54,663
If the rest of the world fits in
around him, that's fine,

1245
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:57,399
if they can't,
it doesn't bother him.

1246
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:11,413
( no voice )

1247
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,313
Albert, Albert, Albert.

1248
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,348
A pretty neck
and your head spins.

1249
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:50,419
Besso, we must behold and
comprehend the mysterious.

1250
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:53,989
Well, that kind of mysterious is
going to get you into trouble.

1251
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,591
I'll tell you what is
truly mysterious:

1252
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,860
the secret of a long
and happy marriage.

1253
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,199
The mathematics are fine,
if a little unconventional,

1254
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,634
but this only works
for big systems.

1255
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:07,603
It'll fall down when
you apply it to small systems.

1256
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,438
I disagree.

1257
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:10,139
BESSO:
Oh, no.

1258
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:11,140
Here we go--

1259
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,175
another grand theory
by Herr Albert Einstein,

1260
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:14,176
Patent Clerk,

1261
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,644
Third Class.

1262
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:19,081
What would happen
if one applied those formulae

1263
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,382
to electromagnetic radiation?

1264
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,483
Albert,

1265
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:24,086
you can't just take one bit
of physics and apply it

1266
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:26,889
without proper regard
to a completely different area.

1267
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,358
Why not?

1268
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,392
Albert.

1269
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:33,262
I know you like
the grand linkages,

1270
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,530
the big theories,

1271
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,899
but wouldn't things
be better all round

1272
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,635
if you just got going
in some small area?

1273
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:40,836
Got a university post.

1274
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:43,539
Get a decent wage,
for God's sake.

1275
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,007
At least Mileva
could study again.

1276
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,009
Then she'd be happy,
and you'd be happy.

1277
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:52,381
Ah, the vulgar struggle
for survival: food and sex.

1278
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,017
Spoken like
a true bourgeois.

1279
01:10:55,017 --> 01:11:00,956
Besso, I want to know
how God created this world.

1280
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:04,360
I am not interested
in this or that phenomenon,

1281
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,129
in the spectrum of this
or that element.

1282
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:09,265
I want to know His thoughts.

1283
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:13,369
The rest... they're details.

1284
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,937
Yes, but you can't
feed your children

1285
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,072
on His thoughts, Bertie.

1286
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,719
KAISER:
So it turns out,
Einstein was going for a walk

1287
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,421
with his very close friend,
Michele Besso.

1288
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:33,856
They'd studied physics together

1289
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,258
and talked about physics and
philosophy for years and years.

1290
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:38,193
They were very close.

1291
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:39,928
They had cornered
the question of light

1292
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,130
from every possible angle.

1293
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,137
See these clocks are over here?

1294
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,039
LITHGOW:
As Einstein and Besso
were ruminating

1295
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:52,107
on how much time it would take
light to reach them

1296
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:55,044
from clocks at different
distances,

1297
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:59,048
Einstein had a monumental
insight.

1298
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:03,819
( church bell tolling )

1299
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,188
( exhales deeply )

1300
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:08,524
Thank you.

1301
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:11,794
Thank you.

1302
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:16,131
I have completely solved
the problem.

1303
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,903
Albert!

1304
01:12:24,306 --> 01:12:29,044
BODANIS:
What Einstein did was completely
turn the problem on its head.

1305
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:31,180
Other scientists
had found it impossible

1306
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,581
to accept Maxwell's idea--

1307
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:34,850
that light would always move
away from you

1308
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,485
at 670 million miles an hour,

1309
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,921
even if you, too, were traveling
really fast.

1310
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:42,024
But Einstein just accepted that
as a fact:

1311
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,493
light's speed
never ever changes.

1312
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:45,861
Then what he did was bend

1313
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,830
everything we know
about the universe

1314
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,365
to fit light's fixed speed.

1315
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,702
What he discovered
was that to do that

1316
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,871
you have to slow down time.

1317
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:59,942
His extraordinary insight
is that time...

1318
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:02,277
as you approach
the speed of light,

1319
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,847
time itself will slow down.

1320
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:07,750
It's a monumental shift
in how we see the world.

1321
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,023
The instant, the very instant

1322
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:18,127
when Einstein had
this brilliant insight

1323
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,195
that time could slow down,

1324
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:22,765
well, the floodgates
began to open.

1325
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:26,301
( clocks ticking )

1326
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:29,638
You see,
before then people had assumed

1327
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:33,542
that time was like a wristwatch
on God's hand,

1328
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:36,845
that it beat at a steady rate
throughout the universe,

1329
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,247
no matter were you were.

1330
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,715
( clock's ticking slowing )

1331
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,016
Einstein said no--

1332
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:44,319
that the tick, tick, tick
of this wristwatch

1333
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,722
was actually
the click, click, click

1334
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:49,191
of electricity turning
into magnetism

1335
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:50,659
turning into electricity.

1336
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:53,929
In other words,
the steady pace of light itself.

1337
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:08,310
BODANIS:
1905 was a miraculous year
for Einstein and for physics.

1338
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:13,582
He had an unbelievable
outpouring of creativity.

1339
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:16,318
It starts with his publication
of a paper

1340
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:19,188
on how to work out
the true size of atoms.

1341
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:20,322
Two months later

1342
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:23,091
is the publication of his paper
on the nature of light--

1343
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:25,194
that's what will earn him
the Nobel Prize.

1344
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,229
The third paper,
only a month later,

1345
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:29,331
is on how molecules move
when heated,

1346
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:33,001
and that finally ends the debate
on whether atoms really exist.

1347
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,670
The fourth paper is published

1348
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,672
at the end
of this half-year period.

1349
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:38,006
In it Einstein sets out

1350
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,042
his theory of light,
time and space.

1351
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:42,044
It was the Theory
of Special Relativity.

1352
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:46,215
That changed the way
we see the world.

1353
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:49,685
LITHGOW:
In Einstein's new world,

1354
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:56,191
the one true constant was not
time or even space, but light.

1355
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:02,164
( steam whistle blowing,
train chugging )

1356
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:08,337
But Einstein's miracle year
was not over.

1357
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,873
( steam hissing, fire roaring )

1358
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:17,479
In one last great 1905 paper,

1359
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,782
he would propose
an even deeper unity.

1360
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,384
( steam whistle blowing )

1361
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,386
As he computed

1362
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:27,456
all the implications
of his new theory,

1363
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:30,659
he noticed
another strange connection,

1364
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:35,097
this one between energy,
mass and light.

1365
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,807
( train whistle blowing )

1366
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:51,213
Einstein realizes
that the speed of light

1367
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,115
is kind of like
a cosmic speed limit.

1368
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:56,451
Nothing can go faster.

1369
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:00,122
So imagine we have a train
charging along,

1370
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:02,858
and let's say it's getting
up to the speed of light

1371
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,794
and we're stuffing
more and more energy in,

1372
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,230
trying to get it to go
faster and faster.

1373
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,700
But it's still bumping up
against the speed of light.

1374
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,468
So all this energy,
where does it go?

1375
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,370
It has to go somewhere.

1376
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:17,639
Amazingly, it goes
into the object's mass.

1377
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:22,444
From our point of view,
the train actually gets heavier;

1378
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,613
the energy becomes mass.

1379
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:36,325
It's an incredible idea.

1380
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:39,027
Even Einstein is amazed by it.

1381
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:45,534
I think I have
found a connection

1382
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,736
between energy and mass.

1383
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:52,507
If I am right, then energy
and mass are not absolute.

1384
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,710
They are not distinct--

1385
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:58,213
they can be converted
into one another.

1386
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:02,784
Energy can become mass,
and mass can become energy.

1387
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:06,455
And not just energy
equaling mass.

1388
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:12,661
Energy equals mass times the
square of the speed of light.

1389
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,930
( cackles; laughs softly )

1390
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,100
Would you like me to check
your mathematics?

1391
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:31,546
LITHGOW:
Einstein sent his fifth great
1905 paper for publication.

1392
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:36,151
In three pages he simply stated
that energy and mass

1393
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:40,789
were connected by the square
of the speed of light--

1394
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:44,626
E equals m c-squared.

1395
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:54,903
With four familiar notes
in the scale of nature,

1396
01:17:54,903 --> 01:18:01,276
this patent officer had composed
a totally fresh melody--

1397
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:06,214
the culmination of his ten-year
journey into light.

1398
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:10,819
Here we are
for thousands of years

1399
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:14,022
thinking that over here is
a world of objects, of matter,

1400
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,591
and over there is
an entirely separate world

1401
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:18,560
of movement,
of forces, of energy.

1402
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,263
And Einstein says,
No, they are not separate.

1403
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,798
Energy can become mass,

1404
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:25,600
and crucially,
mass can also become energy.

1405
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,738
There is a deep unity between
energy, matter and light.

1406
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,776
KAKU:
E equals m c-squared.

1407
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:38,947
That equation shows that every
piece of matter in our universe

1408
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:43,218
has stored within it
a fantastic amount of energy.

1409
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,220
The speed of light, for example,

1410
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,656
is about 300 million meters
per second.

1411
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:51,860
You multiply that by itself
and you get 90 quadrillion.

1412
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:54,329
So in other words,
what is matter?

1413
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:58,200
In some sense, matter is nothing
but the condensation

1414
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,168
of vast amounts of energy.

1415
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,270
So in other words,
if you could unlock...

1416
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:06,641
somehow unlock all the energy
stored within my pen,

1417
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:11,379
that would erupt with a force
comparable to an atomic bomb.

1418
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:25,527
After Einstein's fifth
great 1905 paper,

1419
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:29,331
physicists no longer spoke
of mass or energy--

1420
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,433
they are now
the same thing to us.

1421
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,501
( steam hissing )

1422
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:52,220
LITHGOW:
Probably the most miraculous
year in science ends in silence.

1423
01:19:55,023 --> 01:20:00,662
The articles are published
to resounding... nothing.

1424
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:03,365
EINSTEIN ( voice echoing ):
I think the Gods

1425
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:04,599
are laughing at me.

1426
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:10,772
LITHGOW:
Then slowly it starts.

1427
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:13,408
A letter here, a letter there.

1428
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:17,779
For four years Einstein answered
each inquiry dutifully,

1429
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:21,216
trying to explain
his difficult, complex ideas

1430
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:24,019
to a confused physics community.

1431
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:30,592
GATES:
I love the idea that life
just went on as normal.

1432
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:35,664
Here are these universe-changing
papers circling around,

1433
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,733
and the world is... struggling
to come to terms with them.

1434
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,806
KAKU:
Einstein had a fan club

1435
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:46,575
of just one.

1436
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:51,012
Luckily it happened to be the
most important living physicist.

1437
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,548
SUPERVISOR:
Einstein.

1438
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,684
Einstein.

1439
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,887
Max Planck has sent
someone to see you.

1440
01:20:58,887 --> 01:20:59,888
Max Planck?

1441
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:00,889
Yes.

1442
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,691
He has sent
his assistant.

1443
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,659
He's here to see you.

1444
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:15,170
LITHGOW:
Max Planck encourages the
world's most eminent physicists

1445
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,105
to take Einstein seriously.

1446
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,342
After four years of waiting,

1447
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:24,946
he is appointed professor of
physics at Zurich University.

1448
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,851
From there his career
is meteoric.

1449
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:33,989
He is made
professor of physics in Berlin,

1450
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:39,027
achieves world renown
and becomes a household name.

1451
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:44,299
He is the undisputed father
of modern physics.

1452
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:03,919
But Einstein's success was
the downfall of his marriage.

1453
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:11,960
In 1919 he divorced Mileva
and married his cousin.

1454
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,334
His fame led to
numerous affairs.

1455
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:59,941
E equals m c-squared became
the Holy Grail of science.

1456
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:04,079
It held out the promise
of vast reserves of energy

1457
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,448
locked deep inside the atom.

1458
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:07,949
Einstein suspected

1459
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:10,819
that it would take a hundred
years of research to unlock it.

1460
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:14,255
But he hadn't banked on
the Second World War

1461
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:18,493
and the genius of a Jewish woman
in Hitler's Germany.

1462
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:45,387
28-year-old Austrian
Lise Meitner was painfully shy.

1463
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,955
Despite her anxiety,

1464
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:50,492
the young doctor of physics
arrived in Berlin

1465
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,794
determined to pursue a career

1466
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:56,164
in the exciting new field
of radioactivity.

1467
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:58,066
Unfortunately, in 1907,

1468
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:02,370
German universities did not
employ female graduates.

1469
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:12,147
Luckily,
one man came to her aid.

1470
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:15,950
Fraulein Meitner?

1471
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:17,452
Yes?

1472
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,355
Otto Hahn. I'm a researcher
in the Chemistry Institute.

1473
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:21,856
Professor Planck
suggested I...

1474
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:25,527
Herr Hahn, I have read
your papers on thorium
and on mesothorium,

1475
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:26,961
and Dr. Planck
suggested that I...

1476
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:28,696
Yes, he suggested
that I speak with you.

1477
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:30,031
I need someone
to collaborate...

1478
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:32,700
I think I could really help
with the physical analysis.

1479
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,169
And the mathematics?

1480
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,639
Yes, yes--
and the mathematics.

1481
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:38,840
Studying radioactive atoms

1482
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,375
has become
so much a collaboration

1483
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,243
between chemistry
and physics these days.

1484
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,479
Yes, yes.

1485
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:46,714
I'll ask Fischer
for a laboratory, then.

1486
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:48,650
Excellent.

1487
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,453
I'll speak to you soon.

1488
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:56,458
LITHGOW:
Lise Meitner had just taken
the first step on a journey

1489
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:59,427
that would irrevocably change
world history.

1490
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:03,264
For her it would be a road
marked with success and renown,

1491
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:07,268
but also with terror
and betrayal.

1492
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,810
BODANIS:
At this time, not a lot
was known about the atom.

1493
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:18,613
At first, people thought

1494
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:20,548
it was like
a miniature solar system;

1495
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:22,851
there's a solid nucleus
of the center

1496
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:25,019
and electrons would spin
around it,

1497
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:27,288
sort of like planets
around our sun.

1498
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,390
A little later, some researchers
proposed

1499
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,993
that the nucleus itself
wasn't a solid chunk

1500
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:33,761
but was made up
of separate particles,

1501
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:34,963
of protons and neutrons.

1502
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:38,099
But then-- in what are called
radioactive metals,

1503
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:40,201
things like radium and uranium--

1504
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:42,837
the nucleus itself
seemed to be unstable,

1505
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,973
leaking out energy
and particles.

1506
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,109
Perhaps this was an example
of E equals m c-squared--

1507
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:50,712
the mass of a nucleus
turning into energy.

1508
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,119
LITHGOW:
Meitner and Hahn's collaboration

1509
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:01,422
to unlock the secrets
of the atom started out

1510
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:03,625
on an extremely unequal footing.

1511
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,161
He was given a laboratory.

1512
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,763
She was forced to work
in a wood shop.

1513
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,999
I see you haven't set
your hair on fire.

1514
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,968
Herr Hahn?

1515
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,870
The boss-- he thinks
that if he lets women

1516
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,172
into the Chemistry Institute

1517
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,806
they'll set
their hair on fire.

1518
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:21,609
Oh... so his beard
must be fireproof.

1519
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,412
( footsteps approaching )

1520
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,248
Good day, Herr Hahn.

1521
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:29,284
Good day.

1522
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,821
You see?

1523
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,924
I am nonexistent

1524
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:37,659
to this place.

1525
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:41,462
At least physicists recognize me
for my abilities.

1526
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,331
Yes, where would
we chemists be

1527
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:46,100
without the steadying hand
of the physicist?

1528
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:05,820
WOMAN:
It took years, but Lise lost
her shyness eventually.

1529
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,456
In 1912, she and Hahn moved

1530
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:11,559
to the brand-new Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute for Chemistry,

1531
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,295
where their status
was really that of equals.

1532
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,200
Lise became the first woman
in Germany ever

1533
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,636
to have the title of professor.

1534
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:44,492
Lise... I have news.

1535
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:47,328
Oh?

1536
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,063
You remember the art student

1537
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:50,331
I told you of?

1538
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:52,267
Yes, Edith.

1539
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,038
Yes, well, I have, um...

1540
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:59,240
asked her to marry me,
and she has accepted.

1541
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,412
Oh...

1542
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:06,914
Oh, Dr. Hahn,
congratulations.

1543
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,386
Yes, well...

1544
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:14,522
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

1545
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:18,259
I'm very pleased for you.

1546
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:22,230
Very pleased.

1547
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:33,441
SIME:
Lise Meitner
was warm-hearted by nature.

1548
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,177
She had many friends

1549
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:40,615
and she may have wanted to have
a closer relationship with Otto.

1550
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:44,886
But it really does seem that
physics was Lise's first love--

1551
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:46,821
maybe even her passion.

1552
01:28:49,257 --> 01:28:54,262
LITHGOW:
The 1920s and '30s were the
golden age of nuclear research.

1553
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:56,631
The largest known nucleus
at the time

1554
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,966
was that of the uranium atom,

1555
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:02,970
containing
238 protons and neutrons.

1556
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,906
Meitner and Hahn
were leading the race

1557
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:07,909
to see if even bigger nuclei
could be created

1558
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:10,978
by adding more neutrons.

1559
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:15,616
So... the atom, pretty familiar:

1560
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:21,089
Nucleus in the center,
electrons... orbiting around.

1561
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:26,127
The nucleus is our focus.

1562
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:32,066
The nucleus, made up
of protons... and neutrons.

1563
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:35,303
Now, the largest nucleus
that we know

1564
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:37,872
is that of the uranium atom.

1565
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:41,576
Its nucleus is
a tightly packed structure

1566
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:47,749
of 238 protons and neutrons.

1567
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:54,489
The thrust of our work
is to try to fire neutrons

1568
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:57,892
into this huge structure,

1569
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:02,463
and if we can get a neutron
to stick in here,

1570
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:05,500
that will be a breakthrough.

1571
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:19,781
LITHGOW:
Meitner may have been on
the brink of a major discovery,

1572
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:24,051
but Germany in the 1930s
was a dangerous place to be,

1573
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:26,754
even for a world-class
scientist.

1574
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:30,691
The Jewess endangers
our institute.

1575
01:30:35,696 --> 01:30:38,433
When the Nazis came to power,
one of the first things they did

1576
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:42,570
was to drive out Jewish
academics from the universities.

1577
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,705
Einstein was very prominent

1578
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:47,408
and for that reason
he was one of the first to go.

1579
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:50,845
He was hounded out of Germany
in 1933.

1580
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:54,415
Lise was not dismissed
at that time.

1581
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:57,852
She was able to stay
because she was Austrian.

1582
01:30:57,852 --> 01:31:01,522
But in March 1938,
Austria was annexed into Germany

1583
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:06,027
and at that point her situation
became untenable.

1584
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:08,229
( inaudible )

1585
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:15,336
What is it?

1586
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,875
Frightening news.

1587
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,577
What's happened?

1588
01:31:24,846 --> 01:31:27,548
Kurt Hess is going around saying
that I should be got rid of.

1589
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:32,587
I, um... I actually knew.

1590
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:33,588
I heard today.

1591
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:34,755
I was going to speak

1592
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:36,390
to the treasurer
of the institute

1593
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:37,925
before I told you.

1594
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:39,760
We're speaking tomorrow.

1595
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:43,965
Come on,
let's get you home.

1596
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:45,933
It's late.

1597
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:53,207
We'll finish up.

1598
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:58,145
LITHGOW:
The pressure on Meitner
was unbearable.

1599
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:01,816
Hahn, who was known
for his anti-Nazi views,

1600
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:05,453
did his best to protect her,
at least initially.

1601
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,589
I need to talk to you
about Lise.

1602
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:10,191
Not now,
I'm too busy.

1603
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,826
We have to protect her.

1604
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:13,895
( sighs )

1605
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:15,796
How?

1606
01:32:15,796 --> 01:32:18,032
What can we do?

1607
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:20,101
The situation
is the way it is.

1608
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:22,503
Who knows what
will happen next?

1609
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:25,473
She can't stay;
it's just not tenable.

1610
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:28,309
But she hasn't got a visa
or even a valid passport.

1611
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:31,178
And she may soon be
forbidden to leave Germany.

1612
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:37,184
We can't harbor a Jew.

1613
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:41,489
If she stays, the regime
will shut us all down!

1614
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:52,733
Lise...

1615
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:01,442
Horlein demands
that you leave.

1616
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,546
You can't
throw her out.

1617
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,918
Horlein says
you should not come

1618
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,587
into the institute
anymore.

1619
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:16,223
Well, I have to write up

1620
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:19,026
the thorium irradiation
tomorrow,

1621
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:20,261
so I have to come in.

1622
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:22,997
You've given up.

1623
01:33:41,482 --> 01:33:44,285
LITHGOW:
When it became clear that
Meitner would be dismissed

1624
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:46,020
and probably arrested,

1625
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,823
physicists all around Europe
wrote letters

1626
01:33:48,823 --> 01:33:50,791
inviting her to conferences,

1627
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,394
giving her an excuse
to leave Germany.

1628
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:56,163
The Nazis refused to let her go.

1629
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,468
In July of 1938,

1630
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,470
a Dutch colleague
traveled to Berlin

1631
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,272
and illegally took Lise
back with him

1632
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:06,907
on a train to Holland.

1633
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:08,676
The trip was so frightening

1634
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:11,445
that at one point
she begged to go back.

1635
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:15,516
Despite the great danger,
she got through.

1636
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:27,294
SIME:
She had lost everything--
her home, her position,

1637
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:30,765
her books,
her salary, her pension,

1638
01:34:30,765 --> 01:34:34,568
even her native language.

1639
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:37,905
She had been cut off
from her work just at the time

1640
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:39,373
when she was leading the field

1641
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:43,377
and was on the brink of
a major scientific discovery.

1642
01:34:45,646 --> 01:34:48,315
LITHGOW:
No matter what
privations she suffered,

1643
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:51,585
Lise was still thinking
of physics.

1644
01:34:51,585 --> 01:34:57,425
Amazingly, she and Hahn were
able to collaborate by letter.

1645
01:34:57,425 --> 01:35:00,895
MEITNER ( composing ):
I hope, my dear Otto,
that after 30 years

1646
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:03,531
of work together and friendship
in the institute,

1647
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,966
that at least
the possibility remains

1648
01:35:05,966 --> 01:35:07,835
that you tell me
as much as you can

1649
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,071
about what
is happening back there.

1650
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:32,960
SIME:
Lise was invited by
an old student friend

1651
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,897
to spend Christmas
on the west coast of Sweden.

1652
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:41,702
Her nephew, Otto Robert Frisch,
who was also a physicist,

1653
01:35:41,702 --> 01:35:43,204
came to join her there.

1654
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:45,906
Aunt?

1655
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:49,610
Aunt?

1656
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:51,746
Aunt?

1657
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,514
Lise, how are you,
my dear?

1658
01:35:56,183 --> 01:35:57,685
Merry Christmas.

1659
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:59,253
Aunt?

1660
01:35:59,253 --> 01:36:01,122
Hmm, I need your help.

1661
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,090
Come on, let's go out.

1662
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:06,293
But I was
hoping you'd help me.

1663
01:36:10,998 --> 01:36:15,035
LITHGOW:
Back in Berlin, Hahn
was getting strange results.

1664
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:16,937
He found no evidence
to suggest

1665
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:19,840
that bombarding the uranium
nucleus with neutrons

1666
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,343
had caused it
to increase in size.

1667
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:26,080
In fact, his experiments
seemed to be contaminated

1668
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,083
with radium, a smaller atom.

1669
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:33,587
He desperately needed
Meitner's expert analysis.

1670
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:35,523
From afar,
she was starting to suspect

1671
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:37,424
that something very different
was happening

1672
01:36:37,424 --> 01:36:38,959
in their experiment.

1673
01:36:41,228 --> 01:36:43,998
Hahn and Strassman are getting
some strange results

1674
01:36:43,998 --> 01:36:45,065
with the uranium work.

1675
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:46,433
Really?

1676
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,435
A couple of months ago,
Hahn told me

1677
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:52,640
that they were finding radium
amongst the uranium products.

1678
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,708
We are looking for
a much bigger element,

1679
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:58,846
and... here we're finding
something much smaller.

1680
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:03,250
I urged Hahn to check again--
it couldn't be radium.

1681
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,785
And now he writes to me

1682
01:37:04,785 --> 01:37:08,589
and tells me that
it's not radium,
it's barium.

1683
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:10,124
But that's even smaller.

1684
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:11,759
Exactly.

1685
01:37:11,759 --> 01:37:14,361
Hahn is sure
that it's another error,

1686
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:16,096
but I don't know anymore.

1687
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:19,133
It is at least possible that
barium is being produced.

1688
01:37:19,133 --> 01:37:21,502
So Hahn still needs you
to interpret the data.

1689
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:24,605
It is my work, too, you know.

1690
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:26,640
Exactly.

1691
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:30,644
Well, I can't be there, can I?

1692
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,549
Come on, let's walk.

1693
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:46,360
Surely he's made
a mistake, hasn't he?

1694
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,362
He hasn't done
what you told him to.

1695
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:49,530
My darling Robert,

1696
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,532
he may not be
a brilliant theorist,

1697
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:55,436
but he's
too good a chemist
to get this wrong.

1698
01:38:02,176 --> 01:38:04,678
SIME:
If you imagine a drop of water--
a big drop--

1699
01:38:04,678 --> 01:38:09,183
it's unstable, on the verge
of breaking apart.

1700
01:38:09,183 --> 01:38:11,552
It turns out
that a big nucleus like uranium

1701
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:13,454
is just like that.

1702
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:16,023
Now for four years,
Meitner and Hahn

1703
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:18,125
and all other physicists
had thought

1704
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:21,028
that if you pump more neutrons
into this nucleus,

1705
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:23,697
it'll just get
bigger and heavier.

1706
01:38:26,834 --> 01:38:29,069
But suddenly,
Meitner and Frisch--

1707
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:32,006
out in the midday snow--
realized

1708
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:34,208
this nucleus
might just get so big

1709
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:35,743
that it would split in two.

1710
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:46,387
If the nucleus is so big that
it has trouble staying together,

1711
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:51,225
then couldn't just a little,
tiny jog from a neutron...

1712
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:52,860
Yes, but if the nucleus
did split,

1713
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,529
the two halves would fly apart
with a huge amount of energy.

1714
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:59,066
Where's that energy going
to come from?

1715
01:38:59,066 --> 01:39:01,268
How much energy?

1716
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:04,872
Well, we worked out that
the mutual repulsion
between two nuclei

1717
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:07,107
would generate
about 200 million
electron volts.

1718
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:10,411
But something
has to supply that energy.

1719
01:39:10,411 --> 01:39:13,714
Wait, let me do
a packing fraction calculation.

1720
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:23,057
The two nuclei

1721
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:27,061
are lighter than the original
nucleus of the uranium

1722
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:29,363
by about one-fifth
of a proton in mass.

1723
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:31,432
What?

1724
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:32,900
So some mass has been lost.

1725
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,371
Einstein's
E equals m c-squared.

1726
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:44,611
If we multiply the lost mass
by the speed of light squared

1727
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:45,679
we get...

1728
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,247
( scribbling )

1729
01:39:49,883 --> 01:39:52,286
200 million electron volts.

1730
01:39:53,687 --> 01:39:56,824
He's split the atom.

1731
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:58,993
No, no, no...

1732
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,661
you've split the atom.

1733
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:12,773
SIME:
It was an amazing discovery.

1734
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:14,008
Of course, in the laboratory

1735
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:16,143
we're talking about
tiny amounts of uranium

1736
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:19,346
and correspondingly
tiny amounts of energy.

1737
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:22,249
But the point is that
the amount of energy released

1738
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:24,218
was relatively large

1739
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:27,488
and that came from
the mass of the uranium itself.

1740
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:30,924
The energy released
was entirely consistent

1741
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:35,129
with Einstein's equation
E equals m c-squared.

1742
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:41,168
LITHGOW:
Meitner and Frisch
published the discovery

1743
01:40:41,168 --> 01:40:43,637
of what they called
nuclear fission

1744
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:45,339
to great acclaim.

1745
01:40:45,339 --> 01:40:48,375
But betrayal awaited them.

1746
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:53,914
Otto Hahn was under pressure
from the Nazi regime

1747
01:40:53,914 --> 01:40:57,317
to write his Jewish colleague
out of the story.

1748
01:40:57,317 --> 01:41:01,955
He alone was awarded the 1944
Nobel Prize for the discovery.

1749
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:04,458
In his speech,
he barely mentioned

1750
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:06,760
the leading role of Meitner.

1751
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:09,763
Bizarrely, even after the war,

1752
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:13,634
Hahn maintained it
was he and not Meitner

1753
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:16,203
who had discovered
nuclear fission.

1754
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:19,907
MEITNER ( composing ):
Now, I want to write
something personal,

1755
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:24,411
which disturbs me
and which I ask you to read

1756
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:27,281
with our more than
40-year friendship in mind

1757
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:30,517
and with the desire
to understand me.

1758
01:41:30,517 --> 01:41:35,989
I am now referred to
as Hahn's long-time co-worker.

1759
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:39,026
How would you feel
if you were only characterized

1760
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:42,162
as the long-time
co-worker of me?

1761
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:46,600
After the last 15 years--

1762
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:50,471
which I wouldn't wish
on any good friend--

1763
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:55,809
shall my scientific past
also be taken from me?

1764
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:58,345
Is that fair?

1765
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:00,781
And why is it happening?

1766
01:42:06,987 --> 01:42:10,457
BODANIS:
Lise Meitner had been working
on this for 30 years.

1767
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:13,460
She'd only broken apart
a handful of atoms,

1768
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:15,229
but that was enough.

1769
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:18,599
Once she had broken even one,
the genie was out of the bottle.

1770
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:22,736
What Meitner had started...
after that,

1771
01:42:22,736 --> 01:42:24,238
physicists around the world

1772
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:28,142
began to realize they could
take it a lot further.

1773
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:32,212
LITHGOW:
In 1942, an intense effort
to build an atom bomb was begun.

1774
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:35,315
All over America,
secret installations sprang up

1775
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:39,820
under the code name
the Manhattan Project.

1776
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,156
Meitner was asked to join
the Manhattan Project,

1777
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,323
and she refused.

1778
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:46,093
She refused to have anything
to do with the atomic bomb.

1779
01:42:46,093 --> 01:42:47,761
But Robert Frisch was different.

1780
01:42:47,761 --> 01:42:50,130
He was an important member
of the team,

1781
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:52,065
because he was convinced
of the need

1782
01:42:52,065 --> 01:42:54,835
to beat the Nazis
in a nuclear arms race.

1783
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:14,288
LITHGOW:
A nuclear bomb was
never used on Germany,

1784
01:43:14,288 --> 01:43:18,592
but the atomic bombs dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

1785
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:21,995
demonstrated the terrible
destructive power

1786
01:43:21,995 --> 01:43:24,331
of E equals m c-squared.

1787
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:41,215
Vast amounts of energy,

1788
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:43,650
in the form
of electromagnetic radiation,

1789
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:47,888
were released from a few pounds
of uranium and plutonium.

1790
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:58,765
While the pure inquisitiveness

1791
01:43:58,765 --> 01:44:01,068
of the world's
most gifted scientists

1792
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:05,405
ironically had brought humanity
a weapon of mass destruction,

1793
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:08,675
the equation's life
has a parallel story

1794
01:44:08,675 --> 01:44:11,845
of creation and beauty.

1795
01:44:28,161 --> 01:44:31,732
Today, young physicists
carry on Einstein's quest.

1796
01:44:31,732 --> 01:44:33,967
Ever since its birth,

1797
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,436
E equals m c-squared
has been used

1798
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:39,406
to delve into the depths
of time,

1799
01:44:39,406 --> 01:44:41,842
to answer the biggest question
of all--

1800
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:43,644
where did we come from?

1801
01:44:51,718 --> 01:44:54,354
At particle accelerators,

1802
01:44:54,354 --> 01:44:56,890
researchers propel
atomic particles

1803
01:44:56,890 --> 01:45:00,427
to the speed of light
and smash them together,

1804
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:03,563
creating conditions
like those in the Big Bang.

1805
01:45:05,365 --> 01:45:07,634
KAISER:
E equals m c-squared
actually tells us

1806
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:10,103
how the Big Bang itself
happened.

1807
01:45:13,874 --> 01:45:15,475
In the first moments
of creation,

1808
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:17,477
the universe was
this immensely dense,

1809
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:20,480
immensely concentrated eruption
of energy.

1810
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,618
As it rushed apart and expanded,
huge amounts of energy, or E,

1811
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:26,553
were converted
into mass, or m.

1812
01:45:26,553 --> 01:45:28,255
Pure energy became matter--

1813
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:29,856
it became the particles
and atoms

1814
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,359
and it eventually formed
the first stars.

1815
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:39,733
BODANIS:
Our sun is a huge furnace
floating in space

1816
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:42,302
and it's powered
by E equals m c-squared.

1817
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:45,339
Now it turns out, every second,

1818
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:49,609
four million tons of solid mass
of the sun disappears.

1819
01:45:49,609 --> 01:45:50,977
It comes out as energy.

1820
01:45:50,977 --> 01:45:52,446
Not just a little bit of energy.

1821
01:45:52,446 --> 01:45:55,082
It's enough to light up
our entire solar system,

1822
01:45:55,082 --> 01:45:57,784
make the solar system
glow with heat and light.

1823
01:45:59,786 --> 01:46:01,788
KAKU:
And not only
do stars emit energy,

1824
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:04,991
in accordance
with E equals m c-squared.

1825
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:09,863
The whole process
actually creates life itself.

1826
01:46:11,732 --> 01:46:14,901
Eventually, a massive star dies,

1827
01:46:14,901 --> 01:46:18,338
the debris floats around,
clusters together,

1828
01:46:18,338 --> 01:46:20,807
gets pulled into the orbits
of another star

1829
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:23,043
and becomes a planet.

1830
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:30,217
We humans and the earth we
stand on are made of stardust.

1831
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:35,155
We are a direct product
of E equals m c-squared.

1832
01:46:38,558 --> 01:46:43,330
LITHGOW:
Building on the work
of scientists through the ages,

1833
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:46,333
new generations are searching
for answers.

1834
01:46:47,934 --> 01:46:52,172
Using bold new tools that reach
almost to the speed of light,

1835
01:46:52,172 --> 01:46:53,974
they can now ask questions

1836
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:57,244
that their predecessors
could never have even imagined.

1837
01:47:06,686 --> 01:47:08,755
As Einstein himself knew,

1838
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:12,459
the journey of discovery
is sometimes painful,

1839
01:47:12,459 --> 01:47:14,795
sometimes joyful.

1840
01:47:14,795 --> 01:47:18,732
It is as old
as human curiosity itself

1841
01:47:18,732 --> 01:47:22,335
and never, ever ends.

1842
01:47:24,137 --> 01:47:26,973
